# LoyaltyFrontApp

## Back-end

If you are doing the front part only, a back end is available at https://test-recrutement.loyaltyexpert.net/
The API documentation is at https://test-recrutement.loyaltyexpert.net/api/doc
Front-end (React or Angular or vueJs or anything else great :) )

For the front end part, you will build a web page that will display a list of products taken from the API built earlier or gave.
Products should be listed in a responsive grid. Think mobile!

- Add pagination
- Add product search
- Add a form to create a new product or update one
- Use React or Angular 1/2 to build the website.

### Bonus:

- Add filtering by brand / categories
- A good look on the frontend will be appreciated
- Add tests

The quality of commits, documentation, logic is important as well.

## Test it by yourself !

Test the project. Once oyu cloned the repo run `npm install` then `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
